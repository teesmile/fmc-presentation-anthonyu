## [What is Antimicrobial?]

- Antimicrobials are agents that either kill microorganisms (biocidal effect) or inhibit their growth (biostatic effect).


## [Antimicrobial Stewardship]

- Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a coordinated program that seeks to promote appropriate use of all anti-microbials, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

## [Why AMS Matters at FMC Keffi]
<v-clicks>

- 4.95 million deaths/year globally, linked to AMR (Lancet 2022).
- 50–70% of hospitalized patients receive antimicrobials (WHO).
- Increasing local AMR rates leading to hard‑to‑treat infections
- Resource constraints: ICU beds, lab diagnostics
- Economic pressure: costs of last‑line drugs and extended hospital stays
- Alignment with Nigeria’s AMR National Action Plan 2024–2028

##  Historical Evolution of Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs)

<v-clicks>

- 1940s: Sir Alexander Fleming warned about emerging antibiotic resistance

- 1996-97: Term "Antimicrobial Stewardship" was coined by McGowan & Gerding; Incorporated into IDSA guidelines.
- 2007: IDSA/SHEA formally endorse Hospital ASPs as a core strategy.
- 2009-13: CDC launches US national stewardship initiatives (Education -> Formal Strategy).
- 2016: WHO & UN General Assembly endorse global ASP; WHO issues toolkits.
- Mid-2010s Onwards: Accreditation bodies & governments (e.g., EU 2017) mandate ASPs globally.

## Nigeria's National AMR Response

<v-clicks>

- 2017-22: Launch of 1st National Action Plan (NAP-1.0) on AMR (One Health: Human, Animal, Env.).

- NAP-1.0 Mid-term Review: ~44% activities completed; Gaps identified (e.g., weak environmental/agricultural involvement).

- Oct 2024: Launch of NAP-2.0 (2024-2028) - Aligns with UN/Global Health Security.

- **NAP-2.0 Priorities:** 

  - Strengthen ASPs.

  - Enhance AMR Surveillance.
  - Promote Research.
  - Bolster Health Systems (One Health).

## ASP Implementation in Nigerian Hospitals so far

<v-clicks>

- Only 13% to 35% of Nigerian tertiary hospitals have formal ASP teams/committees.(Ohaju-Obodo et al., 2020).

- Critical gaps exist: ~24% have local treatment guidelines & only ~12% enforce mandatory antibiotic review/approval.

- Pharmacists commonly perform ad-hoc stewardship (e.g., prescription review) despite lacking formal ASP programs (Ogunnigbo et al., 2021).

- Key barriers: Insufficient AMS/Prof. training, shortage of Prof-specialized pharmacists, & weak administrative support.

- Nigerian hospitals show "significant inadequacies" in ASP implementation.
