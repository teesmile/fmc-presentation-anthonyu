## [ðŸ”Œ API and Its Function]{.text-teal-400}

<br>

<v-clicks>

- The primary responsibility of a front end developer is to create pixel perfect UI and also
  to make the UI functional and usable.
- APIâ€™s are endpoints to Github. There is always a documentation on every API.
- You can make use of Github API to create a repository,and also use it to comment
- **FETCH** is used to make APIâ€™S calls .Making APIâ€™s calls is like you are talking to a particular backend/ endpoint.
- **XMLHttpRequest** can also be used to make API calls
- APIâ€™s are also used to submit forms.
- There are different ways to talk to the APIâ€™s which are : **GET**, **POST**.

</v-clicks>

---

**GET**

This is a single way to fetch information back to us.Example of the GET request is when you visit a browser.

  <img src="../images/pic.jpg" style="width: 80%; margin: auto"/>

---

**POST**

Basically means to send the browser an information to get back another information.
the browser cannot make a POST request as a first request inside a URL tab especially.

A very good example of POST is when you fill a form or sign up by inputting your name,address,email and other data and submit,then you log in and it returns a feedback which indicates that your information has been received. i.e a token,which can further be sent to another API called USERS.Then the `Headers` must be parsed in using the token which is encrypted with the userâ€™s details. This confirms that it's the same user registered that is logged in.

**Code**

```js
Const response = await fetch (â€˜/api/usersâ€™ {git checkout
    method : â€˜POSTâ€™,
headers : {
 â€˜content-Typeâ€™ : â€˜application/jsonâ€™,
  }
body : JSON.stringify (user) ,
  })
const  result = await response.json ()
```  

---


>The code above shows the process using method POST and we get something called `headers` which is the â€˜content-typeâ€™ called **AUTHORIZATION(BEARER)**.

<br>
<br>

Encryption and Decryption is used to store and reveal user ID using a form of token either cookies or local storage,session etc.
Backend must have a documentation for the frontends to rely on by providing APIâ€™s to communicate with.They are the intermediary between frontend and the database.
There are several tools that can give us the same interface of APIâ€™s, example is the **Github API Docs**.They can be used to create repositories using tokens.

 **Using Curls in the command line**.

<v-clicks>

- Install curl if it isn't already installed on your machine. To check if curl is installed, execute curl --version in the command line.
- Create an access token. For example, create a personal access token or a GitHub App user access token. You will use this token to authenticate your request, so you should give it any scopes or permissions that are required to access the endpoint.

### GitHub API Request

```bash

curl --request GET \
  --url "https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Spoon-Knife/issues" \
  --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```

---


- In most cases, you can use `Authorization: Bearer`or `Authorization: token` to pass a token. However, if you are passing a JSON web token (JWT), you must use Authorization: Bearer.

<br>

>There are API's used to generate token and auntheticate ID's.We have **WEATHER API'S**,**JSONPLACEHOLDER**.
>There is an npm package called **JSONSERVER** used to create API'S when there is no API that meets
>our needs by creating a fake data that looks like JSON.

<br>

### URLs


Javascript provides a built in URL class that makes working with URL easier and safer.The URL object provides a convenient method to parse in URLs.

---


```js
const url = new URL("https://example.com/products?id=123&category=books");

console.log(url.href); // "Full URL: "https://example.com/products?id=123&category=books"
console.log(url.origin); // "https://example.com"
console.log(url.protocol); // "https:"
console.log(url.hostname); // "example.com"
console.log(url.pathname); // "/products"
console.log(url.search); // "?id=123&category=books"
console.log(url.hash); // "" (empty if not present)
console.log(url.searchParams.get("id")); // "123"
console.log(url.searchParams.get("category")); // "books"

url.searchParams.set("category", "fiction"); // Update parameter
url.searchParams.append("sort", "price"); // Add new parameter
url.searchParams.delete("id"); // Remove a parameter

console.log(url.toString()); // New URL after changes

const newUrl = new URL("https://example.com/page");
newUrl.searchParams.set("user", "alice");
newUrl.searchParams.set("mode", "edit");

console.log(newUrl.toString());
// Output: "https://example.com/page?user=alice&mode=edit"
```
